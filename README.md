## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer working on [GodBot](https://github.com/Hedge4/godvillebot), a custom Discord bot for a Discord server centered around the mobile and desktop comedy game [Godville](https://godvillegame.com/login).
I love a fun programming project from time to time, and don't know how to end this sentence.

You can find me on GitHub, Discord (@wawajabba), [Ko-Fi (wawajabba)](https://ko-fi.com/wawajabba), or at [heddevanheerde4@gmail.com](mailto:heddevanheerde4@gmail.com).

Thanks for visiting my profile!
